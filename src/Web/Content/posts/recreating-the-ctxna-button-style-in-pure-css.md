Although the design of the [CTXNA Web site][1] makes extensive use of images (for
browser compatability), I became curious how difficult the style would be to
reproduce in nothing but CSS and threw together a demo using JSFiddle:

<iframe style='width: 95%; height: 300px; margin: 10px;' src=http://jsfiddle.net/TimGThomas/GyxaD/embedded/result,css,html></iframe>

The complete sample requires a browser that supports CSS gradients and the
`border-radius`, `box-shadow`, and `text-shadow` properties; however, older
browser users will still be able to recogize the button even if it's not _quite_
so pretty. :)
